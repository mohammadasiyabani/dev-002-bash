## introducing
In this repository, we do a dwsclass exercise that identified by `dev-002-bash` ID

There are two files in this repository that means the exercise has two steps.
## step1
In step 1 ,the  `try`  file  we pass some arguments ( -I for delay period nad -n for repeat time ) at the end we pass some commands to this shell script.

#### Example
./try1 [arguments] COMMAND
```bash
./try1 -i 60 -n 5 systemctl start nginx
./try1 -n 6 -i 20 systemctl enable nginx
```

In shell script :
It Gets an argument and sets each to its self variable then saves the ordered command to a variable.

At the first time run command and if ordered command exit with 0 code the script exit with 0 code 

If the ordered command exit with non-zero code, the script run again script in some period that config it in by passing arguments. if the loop ended and ordered command exit with non-zero code the times, script print some errors in stderr and exit with 1 code.

## step2
In step 2 we improved our code!!

#### Example
./try2 [arguments] COMMAND 
```bash
./try2 -i 60 -n 5 systemctl start nginx
./try2 -n 6 -i 20 systemctl enable nginx
./try2 -i 20 systemctl restart nginx
./try2 -n 10 service cups start
./try2 service cups start
```

In this improvement, if you donâ€™t pass the arguments it will get that argument from environment variables and if there is not an environment variable to read from that, it will use default value; but it is necessary to pass the command to it and if no any command passed to this shell script, script exit with 1 code and print an error in stderr
##### default values and environment variables:
`TRY_INTERVAL=5 , TRY_NUMBER=12`
